## Tech Stack

- **Angular V20**: The core framework used to build the application, handling routing, state management, and the overall architecture.
- **D3.js**: A powerful charting library used to create dynamic, interactive visualizations. In this project, it's used for rendering a pie chart based on categorized expenses.
- **AG-Grid**: A highly customizable grid used to display expenses in a tabular format. AG-Grid helps users interact with their data efficiently, supporting features like pagination, sorting, and filtering.
- **Angular Material**: A set of UI components based on Material Design principles, used to enhance the application's look and feel with modern, responsive components such as buttons, icons, and grids.

## Features

- **Expense Grid**: Displays a table of expenses with columns for date, amount, and category.
- **Pie Chart**: A dynamic D3.js pie chart visualizing the total expenses per category (e.g., Food, Housing, Health, etc.).
- **LocalStorage Sync**: All expenses are saved to and loaded from `localStorage`, allowing persistence across sessions. The app listens for `storage` events and updates the grid and chart accordingly.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, leveraging Angular Material and CSS Flexbox to ensure it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### 4. Build the Application

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Docker Setup
Follow these steps to build and run the app in a Docker container.
### 1. Build the Docker Image
From the root of the project, where your Dockerfile is located, run the following command:
```bash
docker build -t expense-tracker .
```
### 2. Run the Docker Container
After the image is successfully built, you can run the container with:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 expense-tracker
```
This will run the application in the container and map the containerâ€™s port 80 to your local port 8080.

Now, you should be able to access the app in your browser at http://localhost:8080.
### 3. Clean Up Docker Containers and Images (Optional)
